# CFB WHEEL

This project is for the upcoming CFB25 game which reads 135 college football teams all with different weights associated to them depending on their level of success.

Example: Ohio State is a 6 star team, FIU is a 1 star team

Based on the weights of teams, this program will spin a wheel and randomly select a team for you. The higher the star rating of a team the less likely you are to receive that team. So in layman terms, if the team is a lower tier (not as successful) you are more likely to receive that team on a "spin", compared to a team such as Alabama you are less likely to roll Alabama.

This program is mainly for the die hard CFB fans, those that played NCAA 14 and brought a 1 star team to a national powerhouse caliber team. This just makes your selection a bit easier.
